[[{"l":"Welcome to the MPV Guide"},{"l":"Overview","p":["mpv is a free (as in freedom) media player for the command line, renowned for its versatility, lightweight design, and extensive customizability. It supports a wide variety of media file formats, audio and video codecs, and subtitle types, ensuring compatibility with virtually any media content. As a fork of MPlayer and mplayer2, mpv is designed for enthusiasts and power users, offering a minimalist yet powerful playback solution across platforms such as Linux, Windows, macOS, and Android.","With a focus on performance and flexibility, mpv allows users to fine-tune every aspect of playback through simple configuration files, from video scaling to subtitle styling. Its command-line interface, paired with advanced features like high-quality video rendering and hardware acceleration, positions mpv as a leading choice for those seeking a streamlined media experience. mpv benefits from active development, with a focus on code optimization, feature enhancements, and community-driven improvements. The project welcomes contributions, whether through patches, feature requests, or bug reports, ensuring that mpv remains at the forefront of media playback technology. Additionally, its developer-friendly C API facilitates seamless integration into custom applications, making it a versatile choice for developers (Wikipedia)(Arch Wiki).","[Placeholder for MPV logo or screenshot]"]},{"i":"why-choose-mpv","l":"Why Choose mpv?","p":["mpv stands out as a top choice for media playback due to its superior performance, extensive customization, and commitment to quality. Unlike other media players, mpv prioritizes a lightweight, minimalist design while delivering advanced features tailored for enthusiasts and power users.","mpv","The following players are not recommended and should be avoided:","MPC-HC- Outdated with lower-quality rendering, with or without madVR.","Potplayer- Has previously shipped with adware.","VLC- Introduces visual artifacts (distortions or anomalies in the video image, categorized as temporal if more visible during playback or spatial if visible when paused), displays wrong colors, and breaks intensive subtitles.","[Placeholder for comparison image: mpv vs. other media players]"]},{"l":"Key Features","p":["Explore the powerful features that make mpv a preferred media player for enthusiasts and developers alike."]},{"l":"High-Quality Video Output","p":["mpv delivers exceptional video playback through its OpenGL, Vulkan, and D3D11-based video output. It supports advanced features coveted by videophiles, including high-quality scaling algorithms (e.g., Lanczos, Spline), precise color management, frame timing, interpolation for smoother motion, HDR support, and more. These capabilities ensure a visually stunning experience, whether you’re watching standard or high-definition content (Scum’s Guide).","[Placeholder for video demo of high-quality playback]"]},{"l":"GPU Video Decoding","p":["mpv leverages hardware acceleration through most GPU decoding APIs, including VA-API, VDPAU, NVDEC, and DirectX Video Acceleration, across all supported platforms. Hardware decoding can be enabled on demand, optimizing performance by offloading processing to the GPU, which is especially beneficial for high-resolution or 4K video playback (Kokomins).","[Placeholder for gif comparing playback with/without hardware decoding]"]},{"l":"On-Screen Controller","p":["While mpv prioritizes a minimalist, GUI-free experience, it provides an On-Screen Controller (OSC) for intuitive interaction. This lightweight overlay, displayed above the video, offers essential controls such as play, pause, and seek, ensuring accessibility without compromising the player’s streamlined design. The OSC can be customized via configuration settings to suit your preferences (Arch Wiki).","[Placeholder for screenshot of the OSC interface]"]},{"l":"Scripting and Customization","p":["mpv offers advanced scripting capabilities, empowering users to extend its functionality to meet diverse needs. With support for Lua, JavaScript, and C plugins, you can automate tasks, enhance playback, or integrate custom features. A wide array of user-contributed scripts is available on the mpv wiki, enabling capabilities such as dynamic playlists, streaming enhancements, and UI modifications. Additionally, mpv supports custom skins like ModernX and uosc to personalize the OSC’s appearance (The Wiki).","[Placeholder for screenshot of a custom script or skin in action]"]},{"l":"Embeddable","p":["Designed with developers in mind, mpv features a straightforward C API that facilitates seamless integration into other applications.
